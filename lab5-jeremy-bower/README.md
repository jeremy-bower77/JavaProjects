# Lab5
## Lab5 Assignment Repository

**Lab5 includes one (1) Java file and two (2) text files. Please maintain the filenames in your lab.**

Remember to completely fill out the header block and *remove any documentation reminders* in the Java template file. **Do not** document the text files. These are meant to hold your non-volatile/permanent data from the application.

**Do make sure to remove the placeholder text in the two text files before using them in the lab.**

As you work on **Lab5** remember to **Save All**, **Commit** (with a message) and **Push Upstream** as often as possible.

## When your Lab5 is complete do the following:

1. Save the project (Save All)
2. Commit with a descriptive message
3. Push Upstream to your Repository
4. Go to your GitHub repository in a Web Browser
5. **Check your repository submission for complete files.**
6. Take a screen shot of your **repository main page** making sure the repository name and last commit message are present
7. Go to your eLearning DropBox
8. Upload your repository image named **Lab5classID** to the DropBox. So if Bubba Jones submitted, it would be **Lab5bjones4242**
9. Place your complete **repository URL (copy and paste it)** into the DropBox comment section
10. Submit your DropBox

### Failure to follow these submission instructions may result in Lab5 not being evaluated.

**Remember to save and commit often.**
